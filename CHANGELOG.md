### üÜï Added

* **PostgreSQL Source**: Added `PostgresSource` class to support querying PostgreSQL databases for breach data
  * Configurable via `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable
  * Includes connection pooling for performance and reliability
  * Supports graceful shutdown with proper connection cleanup
  * Added to both server.js and search.js CLI tool

* **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Reorganized and enhanced testing infrastructure
  * Created proper directory structure: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/helpers/`, `tests/fixtures/`
  * Added unit tests for all source classes (Source, PlaintextDirSource, PostgresSource, ShardSource)
  * Created integration tests for data source functionality and basic API testing
  * Added test configuration helpers and mock data fixtures
  * Integrated test coverage reporting with c8 (66% line coverage achieved)
  * Created enhanced test runner script with coverage support

* **Test Dependencies and Configuration**:
  * Added mocha, chai, supertest, nyc, sinon, and c8 for comprehensive testing
  * Created `.mocharc.json` and `.c8rc.json` configuration files
  * Added npm test scripts for unit, integration, and coverage testing

### üîÑ Changed

* **Data Sources Architecture**: Extended pluggable sources to include PostgreSQL database queries
* **Environment Configuration**: Added `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` to .env.example and documentation
* **Documentation**: Updated README.md with PostgreSQL source configuration and schema requirements
* **Test Structure**: Moved integration and utility scripts from root to `tests/` and `scripts/` directories
* **Server Export**: Modified server.js to export app for testing while maintaining standalone functionality

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

* **PostgresSource**: Fixed constructor validation and connection management to prevent double-close errors
* **ShardSource**: Fixed case-insensitive email hashing to normalize email case internally
* **Test Runner**: Fixed template literal syntax errors in scripts/test-runner.js
* **Coverage Reporting**: Migrated from nyc to c8 for better ESM module support and working coverage reports

### üÜï Added

* **Log Rotation**: Introduced access logs under logs/ directory with daily rotation using `file-stream-rotator`

### üîÑ Changed

* **index.html**:

  * Added an error banner div to display error codes returned from the server.
  * Improved the error handling for non-success server response codes.

* **server.js**:

  * Added rate limiter to the /api/verify-code endpoint to prevent bruteforce.

### üêõ Fixed

* **ShardSource.js**:

  * Populated the source as per the parsed json shard, instead of the shard location.

## 2025-05-30

### üÜï Added

* **Pluggable Sources Architecture**: Introduced a `Source` interface to support multiple breach data formats.
* **ShardSource.js**: New module for JSONL/.jsonl.gz shard lookup, HMAC‚ÄêSHA256 hashing, directory/file discovery.
* **PlaintextDirSource.js**: New module for two‚Äêlevel (and optional third level) plaintext directory lookup using case‚Äêinsensitive grep, with `source: "Other"`.
* **merge-shards.js**: Node.js script to merge multiple shard directories into a base directory, with:

  * Status file `.merge-progress.json` to track `in-progress` and `done` states for audit.
  * Resume support on interruption.

### üîÑ Changed

* **search.js**:

  * Refactored to use pluggable sources (`ShardSource`, `PlaintextDirSource`).
  * Returns *all* matching records from all configured sources.
  * CLI usage updated to read `EMAIL_HASH_KEY`, `SHARD_DIRS`, and `PLAINTEXT_DIR` from `.env`.

* **server.js**:

  * Refactored to instantiate and query multiple sources in `/api/breaches` endpoint.
  * Maintained JWT authentication, Turnstile, rate‚Äêlimiting, and email verification logic.

* **index.html**:

  * Wrapped JavaScript in `DOMContentLoaded` to ensure event bindings load correctly.
  * Converted form submissions to `type="button"` to prevent full‚Äêpage reloads; disabled caching via `<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-store" />`.
  * Added **Loading‚Ä¶** banner during API queries and disabled lookup button to avoid duplicate clicks.
  * Displayed query duration (`performance.now()`) in the UI.
  * Restored **toast alert** styling and element.

* **README.md**:

  * Added **Data Sources and Formats** section explaining:

    * JSONL shard structure and lookup process.
    * Two‚Äêlevel plaintext directory (with optional third level) and grep‚Äêbased lookup.

* **Throttling**  
  - Introduced multi-layer throttling with externalized parameters in `config.js` for:
    - Per-IP lookup rate limits (`lookupRateLimit`)  
    - Per-email verification code rate limits (`codeRateLimit`)  
    - Concurrency limits on shard searches (`concurrencyLimit`)  
    - CPU load-average circuit breaker (`cpu.loadFactor`)  
    - Memory-usage guard (`memory.usageFactor`)  
  - Documented proxy-level rate limiting via `limit_req_zone` and `limit_req` in the NGINX config.

### üêõ Fixed

* **search.js**:

  * Corrected bug where only the first match was returned; updated to collect and print all matches.
